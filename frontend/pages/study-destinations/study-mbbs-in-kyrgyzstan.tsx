    description:"Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked country in Central Asia, bordering Kazakhstan, China, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The mountainous region of the Tian Shan covers over 80% of the country (Kyrgyzstan is occasionally referred to as 'the Switzerland of Central Asia', as a result), with the remainder made up of valleys and basins. Issyk-Kul Lake is the largest lake in Kyrgyzstan which is situated in the north-eastern Tian Shan and the second largest mountain lake in the world after Titicaca. Heavy snowfall in winter leads to spring floods which often cause serious damage downstream. The runoff from the mountains is also used for hydro-electricity.",
    description2:"Kyrgyzstan has significant deposits of metals including gold and rare-earth metals. Due to the country's predominantly mountainous terrain, less than 8% of the land is cultivated, and this is concentrated in the northern lowlands and the fringes of the Fergana Valley.Bishkek in the north is the capital and largest city. The second city is the ancient town of Osh, located in the Fergana Valley near the border with Uzbekistan."
