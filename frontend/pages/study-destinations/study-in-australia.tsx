                            important contribution to British efforts during the First and Second World Wars.

                            significant part of the Australian economy, accounting for about 70% of GDP and 75% of jobs. In 2016 Australia was facing a range of growth constraints, principally driven by a sharp fall in global prices of key
                            export commodities. The demand for resources and energy from Asia and especially China, has declined.
