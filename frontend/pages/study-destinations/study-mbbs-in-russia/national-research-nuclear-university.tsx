              </div>
              <p>
                MEPhI is a public technical university in Moscow, Russia. It was founded in the year 1942 as the Moscow Mechanical Institute of Munitions, but later renamed as Moscow Mechanical Institute. Its original mission was to train
                skilled personnel for the Soviet military and Soviet atomic bomb project. The history of the National Research Nuclear University began with the creation of the Moscow Institute of Mechanical Munitions in 1942. Later, the
                main Russian nuclear university and leading Soviet scientists, including the head of the Soviet Union, were established there. The Igor Kurchatov Atomic Project played a role in its development and creation. Six Nobel
                Laureates have worked at MEPhI throughout its history: Nikolay Basov, Andrei Sakharov, Nikolay Semenov, Igor Tamm, Ilya Frank and Pavel Cherenkov Subsequently again it was renamed the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute in
                the year 1953, which was its name until 2009.
              </p>
              <p>
                Later, on the pilot project launching on creating National Research Universities" MEPhI was granted this new status. The aim of the university existence is now preparing the specialists by giving them higher professional,
                post-graduation professional, secondary professional and additional professional education, as well as educational and scientific activities.
