                    <li>Surgical robot is a rack which is performed with the help of four manipulators. The Surgeon with the help of the increased three-dimensional image of high definition (3D, HD) visualize anatomical structures in a more detailed manner, which, together with precision instruments with high freedom of movement, provides the most accurate tissue dissection. An operating surgeon, located behind the remote control console, controls the movements of the camera and manipulators and conducts the whole process. </li>
