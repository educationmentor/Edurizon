                        <p className="mt-4 mt-md-3">After all the above documents are submitted to Edurizon Pvt Ltd. We will then process the admission of the candidate. In 2-3 working days the University will send the admission letter of the candidate. After we provide the admission letter, the candidate has to appear for the Skype Interview. The whole interview will be recorded by the university & sent to the Ministry of Georgia. The Ministry will then send a letter to the University confirming his admission and release all the official documents of the students like the confirmation letter, Invitation letter, and University Rector decree. After this the visa process will start, which normally takes 7-10 working days to receive the visa.</p>
