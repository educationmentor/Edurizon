          </div>
          <p>
            India and Kazakhstan relationship has gone a long way in history. There has been a good exchange of thoughts, ideas and goods from the middle ages. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Kazakhstan twice in the year 2015
            and 2017.After the country Kazakhstan became independent in 1991, the relationship between the two countries became more strong. In 2009 the president Nursultan Nazarbayev’s visited India and became good strategic partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kazakhstan is very strong in the area of energy, so there are a lot of opportunities for India to invest in oil and gas sector. The country also has enough uranium and India is interested in ferroalloys, Uranium and Kazakhstan’s
            oil. On the other hand Kazakhstan imports medicines and tea from India.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modi said in his joint presser with Kazakh President that nuclear cooperation is a key pillar of partnership. He said Kazakhstan was one of the first country with which India has launched civil nuclear cooperation through a
            uranium purchase contract. We are pleased to have a much larger second contract now. Upgrading the MoU on defence ties, the agreement on defence and military-technical cooperation would further widen the scope of bilateral
            defence cooperation. Further both the countries have developed a close collaboration in fighting religious terrorism and extremism as well as promotion regional security. Both the countries have also held joint military
            exercises in Kazakhstan in 2016 and in Himachal Pradesh region in 2017.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Kazakh national firm Kazmunay Gaz had also offered ONGC for Indian participation in petrochemical industrial projects in the Atirau and Akhtau regions. Both nations have also sought to establish extensive collaboration and
            commerce in information technology, space research, banking and increasing volume of bilateral trade. India has offered Kazakhstan $1,000,000,000 in loans while the latter has granted major tax concessions to Indian companies.
            Kazakhstan has also sought to negotiate a multilateral agreement with Iran and Turkmenistan to create a transport corridor to India to ensure a reliable trade route and provide Kazakhstan commercial and shipping access to the
            warm water ports of India.
